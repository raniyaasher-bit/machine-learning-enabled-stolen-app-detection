# Machine Learning Enabled Stolen App Detection

## Overview
This project is a machine learning based system to detect stolen or repackaged mobile applications.  
The model analyzes application data and predicts whether an app is genuine or suspicious.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Anacinda Prompt
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Decision Tree Algorithm

## How the Project Works
1. Data is collected and cleaned.
2. Important features are selected from the dataset.
3. A Decision Tree model is trained on the data.
4. The trained model is used to classify applications.

## Files in this Repository
- Notebook file containing the code and model
- Project documentation
- Presentation (PPT)

## Result
The model is able to classify applications based on the given features and helps in identifying suspicious or stolen apps.

## Future Improvements
- Use a larger dataset
- Try other machine learning algorithms
- Improve accuracy and feature selection
